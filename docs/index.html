          I<span class="smallcaps">n the spring </span>of 1814, 25 years after
          the ratification of America’s Constitution, a group of 112 Norwegian
          men—civil servants, lawyers, military officials, business leaders,
          theologians, and even a sailor—gathered in Eidsvoll, a rural village
          40 miles north of Oslo. For five weeks, while meeting at the manor
          home of the businessman Carsten Anker, the men debated and drafted
          what is today the world’s second-oldest written constitution.

          Like America’s Founders, Norway’s independence leaders were in a
          precarious situation. Norway had been part of Denmark for more than
          400 years, but after Denmark’s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, the
          victorious powers, led by Great Britain, decided to transfer the
          territory to Sweden. This triggered a wave of nationalism in Norway.

        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment and the promise of
          self-government, Norway’s founders viewed the American experience as a
          path to follow. A few decades earlier, the Americans had done what the
          Norwegians now aspired to do: become independent from a foreign power.

          of the American experiment, casting George Washington and Benjamin
          Franklin as heroes. Although the press didn’t always get the story
          right (it described the American president as a “monarch,” reported
          that Washington had been “appointed dictator of the United States for
          four years,” and referred to the vice president as a “viceroy”), many
          of the men at Eidsvoll were quite familiar with the workings of the
          American system. Christian Magnus Falsen, a prominent independence
          advocate who took a leading role in the constitution-writing process,
          even christened his son George Benjamin, after Washington and
          Franklin. Falsen was deeply influenced by Madison and Jefferson, too,
          later declaring that parts of the Norwegian constitution were brd
          “nearly exclusively” on the American example.

          Despite its flaws, the U.S. Constitution was a pioneering document.
          America became the first large nation to rule itself without a
          monarchy and instead fill its most important political offices via
          regular elections. Over the next century, the American Constitution
          served as a model for republican and democratic-minded reformers
          across the world.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          The United States no longer seems like a good model today. Since 2016,
          America has experienced what political scientists call “democratic
          backsliding.” The country has seen a surge in political violence;
          threats against election workers; efforts to make voting harder; and a
          campaign by the then-president to overturn the results of an
          election—hallmarks of a democracy in distress. Organizations that
          track the health of democracies around the world have captured this
          problem in numerical terms. Freedom House’s Global Freedom Index gives
          countries a score from 0 to 100 each year; 100 indicates the most
          democratic. In 2015, the United States received a score of 90, roughly
          in line with countries such as Canada, France, Germany, and Japan. But
          since then, America’s score has declined steadily, reaching 83 in
          2021. Not only was that score lower than every established democracy
          in Western Europe; it was lower than new or historically troubled
          democracies such as Argentina, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and
          Taiwan.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          The causes of America’s crisis are not simply a strongman and his
          cultlike following. They are more endemic than that. Over the past two
          centuries, America has undergone massive economic and demographic
          change—industrializing and becoming much larger, more urban, and more
          diverse. Yet our political institutions have largely remained frozen
          in place. Today, American democracy is living with the destabilizing
          consequences of this disjuncture.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Indeed, the problem lies in something many of us venerate: the U.S.
          Constitution. America’s founding document, designed in a
          pre-democratic era in part to protect against “tyranny of the
          majority,” has generated the opposite problem: Electoral majorities
          often cannot win power, and when they win, they often cannot govern.
          Unlike any other presidential democracy, U.S. leaders can become
          president despite losing the popular vote. The U.S. Senate, which
          dramatically overrepresents low-population states by giving each state
          equal representation regardless of population, is also frequently
          controlled by a party that has lost the national popular vote. And due
          to the Senate’s filibuster rules, majorities are routinely blocked
          from passing normal legislation. Finally, because the Supreme Court’s
          composition is determined by the president and Senate, which have
          often not represented electoral majorities in the 21st century, the
          Court has grown more and more divorced from majority public opinion.
          Not only does the Constitution deliver outsize advantages to partisan
          minorities; it has also begun to endanger American democracy. With the
          Republican Party’s transformation into an extremist and antidemocratic
          force under Donald Trump, the Constitution now protects and empowers
          an authoritarian minority.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          America was once the standard-bearer for democratic constitutions.
          Today, however, it is more vulnerable to minority rule than any other
          established democracy. Far from being a pioneer, America has become a
          democratic laggard. How did this come to pass?
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Consider what happened in Norway. Though inspired by the American
          experience, Norway’s founding 1814 constitution was hardly
          revolutionary. The country remained a hereditary monarchy, and kings
          retained the right to appoint cabinets and veto legislation. Members
          of Parliament were indirectly elected by regional electoral colleges,
          and voting was limited to men who met certain property requirements.
          Urban elites also gained a powerful built-in advantage in Parliament.
          Norway was overwhelmingly rural in 1814: About 90 percent of the
          electorate lived in the countryside. Because many peasants owned land
          and could therefore vote, wealthy urbanites feared being overwhelmed
          by the peasant majority. So the constitution established a fixed
          2-to-1 ratio of rural to urban seats in Parliament—a ratio that
          dramatically overrepresented cities, because rural residents actually
          outnumbered urban residents by 10 to one. This was the so-called
          Peasant Clause. Majority rule was further diluted by bicameralism:
          Norway adopted an upper legislative chamber elected not by the people
          but by the lower house of Parliament.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Like America’s 1789 Constitution, then, Norway’s 1814 constitution
          included a range of undemocratic features. In fact, early 19th-century
          Norway was considerably less democratic than the United States was.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Over the next two centuries, however, Norway underwent a series of
          far-reaching democratic reforms—all under its original constitution.
          Parliamentary sovereignty was established in the late 19th century,
          and Norway became a genuine constitutional monarchy. A 1905
          constitutional reform eliminated regional electoral colleges and
          established direct elections for Parliament. Property restrictions on
          voting were suspended in 1898, and universal (male and female)
          suffrage came in 1913.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          After 1913, Norway was a democracy. However, one major
          counter-majoritarian institution remained: the Peasant Clause. By the
          mid-20th century, urbanization had reversed the nature of the
          malapportionment caused by the Peasant Clause. With half of the
          population now living in cities, a fixed 2-to-1 rural-to-urban seat
          ratio had come to overrepresent <em>rural </em>voters. Like the U.S.
          Senate, then, the Peasant Clause threatened majority rule by inflating
          the political power of sparsely populated areas—to the benefit of
          conservative parties. Unlike in the United States, however, the major
          political parties negotiated a constitutional reform that eliminated
          the Peasant Clause in 1952. Norway took additional steps toward
          majority rule when it reduced the voting age to 18 in 1978 and
          eliminated its upper chamber of Parliament in 2009.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          But Norway didn’t stop democratizing. As Norwegian society and global
          norms changed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries,
          constitutional and democratic rights were expanded in new ways.
          Indigenous minorities, for example, gained new protections in a 1988
          constitutional amendment. A 1992 constitutional amendment guaranteed
          Norwegians the right to a healthy environment. In 2012, the
          constitution was amended once again, this time to abolish Norway’s
          official religion and guarantee equal rights to “all religious and
          philosophical communities.” And in 2014, Norway adopted a set of
          sweeping constitutional human- and social-rights protections,
          including the right of children to “respect for their human dignity,”
          the right to education, and the right to subsistence (through work or,
          for those who could not support themselves, government assistance). In
          total, Norway’s constitution was amended 316 times from 1814 to 2014.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Two centuries of reform transformed Norway into one of the most
          democratic countries on Earth. On Freedom House’s Global Freedom
          Index, most established democracies received a score above 90 in 2022.
          A handful of countries, including Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, and
          Uruguay, received a score above 95. Only three countries received a
          perfect score of 100: Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Freedom House
          scores countries on 25 separate dimensions of democracy. Norway got a
          perfect score on all of them.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI ArticleParagraph_dropcap__Xra23">
          N<span class="smallcaps">orway’s story</span> of transformation is
          particularly impressive, but its general trajectory is not unusual.
          Other European political systems started in an equally undemocratic
          place, with numerous institutions designed to thwart popular
          majorities. Most of them, like Norway, were ruled by monarchies. With
          few exceptions, only men with property could vote. Voting was usually
          indirect: Citizens voted not for candidates but for local
          “notables”—civil servants, priests, pastors, landowners, or factory
          owners—who in turn selected members of parliament. And in Latin
          America, where founding leaders took the U.S. Constitution as a model
          after gaining independence in the early 19th century, all presidents
          were indirectly elected, via electoral colleges or legislatures, prior
          to 1840.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In addition, early electoral systems were skewed to favor wealthy
          landowners. Cities—home to Europe’s growing working classes—were often
          massively underrepresented in parliament compared with rural
          districts. In Britain’s notorious “rotten boroughs,” a few dozen
          voters sometimes had their very own representative.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Most countries also had extensive legislative checks on popular
          majorities, including undemocratic bodies with the power to veto
          legislation. In Britain, the House of Lords, an unelected body
          composed of hereditary peers and appointees, had the authority to
          block most legislation. Canada also created an appointed Senate after
          it gained independence in 1867. Most 19th-century European political
          systems possessed similar upper chambers, composed of hereditary
          members and appointees from the crown and the Church.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Parliaments everywhere thus offered excessive protection to minority
          interests. An extreme example was Poland’s 18th-century Parliament, in
          which each deputy in the 200-member body possessed individual veto
          over any bill. The French political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
          regarded Poland’s <em>liberum veto</em> (Latin for “I freely object”)
          as, in the words of one legal analyst, a
          <a
            data-event-element="inline link"
            href="http://www.iconnectblog.com/the-modern-liberum-veto/"
            >“tyranny of the minority of one.”</a
          >
          The system’s defenders characterized it as a “privilege of our
          liberty.” But it brought political life to a grinding halt. From 1720
          to 1764, more than half of Poland’s parliamentary sessions were shut
          down by individual vetoes before any decisions were made. Unable to
          conduct government business or raise public funds for defense, Poland
          fell prey to military interventions by neighboring Russia, Prussia,
          and Austria, whose armies dismembered its territory, literally erasing
          Poland from the map for more than a century. (The dysfunctionality of
          the liberum veto was not lost on America’s Founders, including
          Alexander Hamilton, who cited Poland as an example of the “poison” of
          “giv[ing] a minority a negative upon the majority.”)

          Although other countries steered clear of the liberum veto, states
          across Europe lacked rules to halt parliamentary debate, allowing
          small minorities to routinely scuttle legislative majorities. This
          filibuster-like behavior grew so widespread in Europe that the German
          legal theorist
          <a
            data-event-element="inline link"

          >
          in 1904 that “parliamentary obstruction is no longer a mere intermezzo
          in the history of this or that parliament. It has become an
          international phenomenon which, in threatening manner, calls in
          question the whole future of parliamentary government.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Across the West, then, early political systems placed elections and
          parliaments beyond the reach of popular majorities, ensuring not just
          minority rights but outright minority rule. In that world of
          monarchies and aristocracies, America’s founding Constitution, even
          with its counter-majoritarian features, stood out as comparatively
          democratic.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Over the course of the 20th century, however, most of the countries
          that are now considered established democracies dismantled their most
          egregiously counter-majoritarian institutions and took steps to
          empower majorities. They did away with suffrage restrictions.
          Universal male suffrage first came to France’s Third Republic in the
          1870s. New Zealand, Australia, and Finland were pioneers of female
          enfranchisement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1920,
          virtually all adult men and women could vote in most of Western
          Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Indirect elections also disappeared. By the late 19th century, France
          and the Netherlands had eliminated the powerful local councils that
          had previously selected members of parliament; Norway, Prussia, and
          Sweden did the same in the early 20th century. France experimented
          with an electoral college for a single presidential election in the
          late 1950s, but then dropped it. Electoral colleges gradually
          disappeared across Latin America. Colombia eliminated its electoral
          college in 1910; Chile did so in 1925; Paraguay in 1943. Brazil
          adopted an electoral college in 1964 under military rule but replaced
          it with direct presidential elections in 1988. Argentina, the last
          country in Latin America with indirect presidential elections, dropped
          its electoral college in 1994.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Most European democracies also reformed their electoral systems—the
          rules that govern how votes are translated into representation.
          Countries across continental Europe and Scandinavia abandoned
          first-past-the-post election systems when they democratized at the
          turn of the 20th century. Beginning in Belgium in 1899, Finland in
          1906, and Sweden in 1907, and then diffusing across Europe, coalitions
          of parties from across the spectrum pushed successfully for
          proportional representation with multimember districts (meaning
          multiple members of parliament are elected from a single district) to
          bring parties’ share of the seats in parliament more closely in line
          with their share of the popular vote. Under these new rules, parties
          that won, say, 40 percent of the vote could expect to win about 40
          percent of the seats, which, as the political scientist Arend Lijphart
          has shown, helps ensure that electoral majorities translate into
          governing majorities. By World War II, nearly all continental European
          democracies used some variant of proportional representation, and
          today 80 percent of democracies with populations above 1 million do
          so.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Undemocratic upper chambers were tamed or eliminated beginning, in the
          early 20th century, with Britain’s House of Lords. Britain experienced
          a major political upheaval in 1906 when the Liberal Party won a
          landslide election, displacing the Conservatives (or Tories), who had
          governed for more than a decade. The new Liberal-led government
          launched ambitious new social policies, which were to be paid for with
          progressive taxes on inherited and landed wealth. Outnumbered by more
          than two to one in Parliament, the Conservatives panicked. The House
          of Lords, which was dominated by conservative-leaning hereditary
          peers, came to the Tories’ rescue. Inserting itself directly into
          politics, the unelected upper chamber vetoed the Liberal government’s
          all-important tax bill of 1909.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          By convention, the House of Lords could veto some legislation, but not
          tax bills (fights over taxation had sparked the English Civil War in
          the 1640s). The House of Lords nonetheless voted down the ambitious
          budget bill, breaking all precedent.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          The Lords justified this unusual move by claiming that their chamber
          was a “watchdog of the constitution.” The Liberal chancellor of the
          Exchequer, David Lloyd George, the main author of the budget bill,
          dismissed this, calling the House of Lords a plutocratic body—“not a
          watchdog” but rather the “poodle” of the Conservative Party leader. In
          a speech to a roaring crowd in London’s East End, the sharp-tongued
          Lloyd George ridiculed the aristocrats who inherited their seats in
          the House of Lords as “500 ordinary men, accidently chosen from among
          the ranks of the unemployed,” and asked why they should be able to
          “override the deliberate judgment of millions.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Facing a constitutional crisis, the Liberals drew up the Parliament
          Act, which would strip the House of Lords of its ability to veto any
          legislation at all. If the House of Lords lost its veto, its
          Conservative members warned, political apocalypse would follow. It
          wasn’t just taxes they feared. They worried about other items on the
          Liberal-led majority’s agenda, including plans to grant Catholic
          Ireland greater autonomy, which Conservatives viewed as a fundamental
          affront to their traditional (Protestant) vision of British national
          identity.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Ultimately, the bill passed not only the House of Commons but also the
          House of Lords. It took some hardball. The Lords were persuaded after
          the Liberal government, with the King’s support, threatened to swamp
          the House of Lords by appointing hundreds of new Liberal peers to the
          body if it did not relent. With the bill’s passage, the House of Lords
          lost the ability to block laws passed by the elected House of Commons
          (although it could delay them). One of Britain’s most powerful
          counter-majoritarian institutions had been substantially weakened. And
          rather than trigger a crisis, the reform paved the way for the
          construction of a fuller, more inclusive democracy over the course of
          the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Several other emerging democracies abolished their aristocratic upper
          chambers outright after World War II. New Zealand eliminated its House
          of Lords–like Legislative Council in 1950. Denmark abolished its
          19th-century upper chamber in 1953 via referendum. Sweden followed
          suit in 1970. By the early 21st century, two-thirds of the world’s
          parliaments were unicameral. The result was not—as defenders of upper
          chambers frequently warned—political chaos and dysfunction. New
          Zealand, Denmark, and Sweden went on to become three of the most
          stable and democratic countries in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Another way to democratize historically undemocratic upper chambers is
          to make them more representative. This was the path taken by Germany
          and Austria. In Germany, following World War II, West Germans wrote a
          new democratic constitution under the watchful eye of American
          occupying forces. One of the main tasks facing Germany’s
          constitutional designers was to revamp the country’s 19th-century
          second chamber, which historically was composed mostly of appointed
          civil servants. They considered several options. Despite the outsize
          role played by American occupying forces, they rejected the U.S.
          Senate model of equal representation for federal states. Instead,
          representation in the Bundesrat would be brd roughly on states’
          populations. So Germany’s second chamber remained in place but was
          made more representative. Today, the smallest German states each send
          three representatives to the Bundesrat, medium-size states send four
          representatives, and the largest states send six representatives. With
          this structure, Germany’s postwar framers combined principles of
          federalism and democracy.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Most 20th-century democracies also took steps to limit minority
          obstruction within legislatures, establishing a procedure—known as
          “cloture”—to allow simple majorities to end parliamentary debate. The
          term <em>cloture</em> originated during the early days of the French
          Third Republic. In the 1870s, the provisional government of Adolphe
          Thiers faced daunting challenges. France had just lost a war to
          Prussia, and the new Republican government had to contend with the
          revolutionary Paris Commune on the left and forces seeking to restore
          the monarchy on the right. The government needed to show it could
          legislate effectively. However, the National Assembly was renowned for
          its marathon debates and inaction on pressing issues. Pushed by
          Thiers, the assembly created a cloture motion through which a
          parliamentary majority could vote to rein in an otherwise endless
          debate.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Britain carried out similar reforms. In 1881, Liberal Prime Minister
          William Gladstone pushed through a “cloture rule” that allowed a
          majority of members of Parliament to end debate so that Parliament
          could move to a vote. The Australian Parliament adopted a comparable
          cloture rule in 1905. In Canada, opposition minorities in Parliament
          had filibustered several important bills, including the Naval Aid Bill
          introduced by the Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden in 1912.
          The bill aimed to respond to the rise of German sea power by
          bolstering Canada’s navy but was filibustered by the opposition
          Liberals for five months. The debate took a physical toll on the prime
          minister, who developed such severe boils that he was forced to take
          the floor with his “neck swathed in bandages.” The ordeal led the
          government to push through a cloture rule—allowing a simple majority
          to end debate—in April 1913.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          The trend of eliminating filibusters and other supermajority rules has
          continued in recent decades. For much of the 20th century, Finland’s
          Parliament had a delaying rule under which a one-third minority could
          vote to defer legislation until after the next election. The rule was
          abolished in 1992. Denmark still has a rule in which a one-third
          parliamentary minority may call a public referendum on nonfinancial
          legislation, and if 30 percent of the adult population votes against
          (a high bar given low voter turnout), it is blocked. However, this
          rule has not been used since 1963. Iceland’s Parliament (known as the
          Althingi) long had an old-fashioned talking filibuster. The
          secretary-general of the Althingi, Helgi Bernódusson,
          <a
            data-event-element="inline link"
            href="https://www.asgp.co/sites/default/files/Bernodusson%2C%20%20Iceland.docx"
            >described</a
          >
          it as “deeply rooted in the Icelandic political culture.” Efforts to
          curb the filibuster were met with considerable resistance because they
          were viewed as threatening the “freedom of speech” of members of
          Parliament. In 2016, Bernódusson declared, “There are no indications
          at present that it will be possible to curb filibustering … The
          Althingi is stuck in the filibuster rut.” Three years later, however,
          after a record-breaking 150-hour filibuster on a European Union energy
          law, the Parliament curbed the filibuster through new limits on
          speeches and rebuttals.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Amid this broad pattern of reform is one area in which many
          democracies moved in a more counter-majoritarian direction in the 20th
          century: judicial review. Prior to World War II, judicial review
          existed in only a few countries outside the United States. But since
          1945, most democracies have adopted some form of it. In some
          countries, including Austria, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, new
          constitutional courts were created as “guardians” of the constitution.
          In other countries, including Brazil, Denmark, India, Israel, and
          Japan, existing supreme courts were given this guardian role.
          <a
            data-event-element="inline link"
            href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198089/a-different-democracy/"
            >One recent study</a
          >
          of 31 established democracies found that 26 of them now possess some
          type of judicial review.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Judicial review can be a source of what we call “intergenerational
          counter-majoritarianism”—when judges appointed decades ago routinely
          strike down legislation backed by present-day majorities. Democracies
          across the world have attenuated this problem by replacing life tenure
          with either term limits or a mandatory retirement age for high-court
          justices. For example, Canada adopted a mandatory retirement age of 75
          for Supreme Court justices in 1927. The law was a response to two
          aging justices who refused to retire, including one who became
          inactive in court deliberations and another whom Prime Minister
          William Lyon Mackenzie King described in his diary as “senile.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Similarly, Australia established a retirement age of 70 for High Court
          justices in 1977, after the 46-year tenure of Justice Edward McTiernan
          came to an inglorious end. McTiernan had been appointed to the court
          in 1930, and by the 1970s, the octogenarian’s voice was often “<a
            data-event-element="inline link"
            href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0067205X9102000201"
            >difficult for counsel to understand</a
          >,” In 1976, McTiernan broke his hip swatting a cricket with a
          rolled-up newspaper at the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne. In an apparent
          effort to nudge him into retirement, the chief justice refused to
          build a wheelchair ramp in the High Court building, citing costs.
          McTiernan retired, and when Parliament took up the issue of
          establishing a retirement age, there was little opposition. Members of
          Parliament argued that a retirement age would help “contemporize the
          courts” by bringing in judges who were “closer to the people” and held
          “current day sets of values.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Every democracy that has introduced judicial review since 1945 has
          also introduced either a retirement age or term limits for high-court
          judges, thereby limiting the problem of long-tenured judges binding
          future generations.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In sum, the 20th century ushered in the modern democratic era—an age
          in which many of the institutional fetters on popular majorities that
          were designed by pre-democratic monarchies and aristocracies were
          dismantled. Democracies all over the world abolished or weakened their
          most egregiously counter-majoritarian institutions. Conservative
          defenders of these institutions anxiously warned of impending
          instability, chaos, or tyranny. But that has rarely ensued since World
          War II. Indeed, countries such as Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
          Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the U.K. were both more
          stable and more democratic at the close of the 20th century than they
          were at the beginning. Eliminating counter-majoritarianism helped give
          rise to modern democracy.

          America also took important steps toward majority rule in the 20th
          century. The Nineteenth Amendment (ratified in 1920) extended voting
          rights to women, and the 1924 Snyder Act extended citizenship and
          voting rights to Native Americans—although it was not until the 1965
          Voting Rights Act that the United States met minimal standards for
          universal suffrage.

        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          America also (partially) democratized its upper chamber. The U.S.
          Senate, which

            >has been provocatively described as</a

          “an American House of Lords,” was indirectly elected prior to 1913.
          The Constitution endowed state legislatures, not voters, with the
          authority to select their states’ U.S. senators. Thus, the 1913
          ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, which mandated the direct
          popular election of senators, was also an important democratizing
          step.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Legislative elections became much fairer in the 1960s. Prior to this,
          rural election districts across the country contained far fewer people
          than urban and suburban ones. For example, Alabama’s Lowndes County,
          with slightly more than 15,000 people, had the same number of state
          senators as Jefferson County, which had more than 600,000 residents.
          The result was massive rural overrepresentation in legislatures. In
          1960, rural counties contained 23 percent of the U.S. population but
          elected 52 percent of the seats in state legislatures. In
          state-legislative and national-congressional elections, rural
          minorities frequently governed urban majorities. In 1956, when the
          Virginia state legislature voted to close public schools rather than
          integrate them in the wake of the 1954
          <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> ruling, the 21 state senators who
          voted for closure represented fewer people than the 17 senators who
          voted for integration.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          From 1962 to 1964, however, a series of Supreme Court rulings ensured
          that electoral majorities were represented in Congress and state
          legislatures. Establishing the principle of “one person, one vote,”
          the court rulings required all U.S. legislative districts to be
          roughly equal in population. Almost overnight, artificial rural
          majorities were wiped out in 17 states. The equalization of voting
          power was a major step toward ensuring a semblance of majority rule in
          the House of Representatives and state legislatures.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          A final spurt of constitutional reforms came in the 1960s and early
          ’70s. The Twenty-Third Amendment (ratified in 1961) gave Washington,
          D.C., residents the right to vote in presidential elections; the
          Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1964) finally prohibited poll taxes; and the
          Twenty-Sixth Amendment (1971) lowered the age to vote from 21 to 18.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          But America’s 20th-century reforms did not go as far as in other
          democracies. For example, whereas every other presidential democracy
          in the world did away with indirect elections during the 20th century,
          in America the Electoral College remains intact.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          America also retained its first-past-the-post electoral system, even
          though it creates situations of minority rule, especially in state
          legislatures. The United States, Canada, and the U.K. are the only
          rich Western democracies not to have adopted more proportional
          election rules in the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          The country’s heavily malapportioned Senate also remains intact. The
          principle of “one person, one vote” was never applied to the U.S.
          Senate, so low-population states like Wyoming continue to elect as
          many senators as populous states like California. As a result, states
          representing a mere 20 percent of American voters can elect a Senate
          majority. America’s state-level “rotten boroughs” persist.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          America also maintained a minority veto within the Senate. Much like
          in legislatures in France, Britain, and Canada, the absence of any
          cloture rule led to a marked increase in obstructionist tactics
          beginning in the late 19th century. And as in Canada, the filibuster
          problem took on added urgency in the face of German naval threats in
          the run-up to World War I. But Canada, like France and Britain, put in
          place a majoritarian 50 percent cloture rule, while the U.S. Senate
          adopted a nearly insurmountable super-majoritarian 67-vote cloture
          rule. The threshold was lowered to three-fifths in 1975, but it
          remains highly counter-majoritarian. America thus entered the 21st
          century with a “60-vote Senate.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Finally, unlike every other established democracy, America did not
          introduce term limits or mandatory retirement ages for Supreme Court
          justices. Today, on the Supreme Court, the justices effectively serve
          for life. It’s an entirely different story at the state level. Of the
          50 U.S. states, 46 imposed term limits on state-supreme-court justices
          during the 19th or 20th century. Three others adopted mandatory
          retirement ages. Only Rhode Island maintains lifetime tenure for its
          supreme-court justices. But among national democracies, America, like
          Rhode Island, stands alone.

              America is one of the few established democracies (along with
              Canada, India, Jamaica, and the U.K.) with first-past-the-post
              electoral rules that permit electoral pluralities to be
              manufactured into legislative majorities and, in some cases, allow
              parties that garner fewer votes to win legislative majorities.

              America is the only democracy in the world with lifetime tenure
              for Supreme Court justices. All other established democracies have
              either term limits, a mandatory retirement age, or both.

          One reason America has become such an outlier is that, among the
          world’s democracies, the U.S. Constitution is the hardest to change.
          In Norway, a constitutional amendment requires a supermajority of
          two-thirds support in two successive elected Parliaments, but the
          country has no equivalent to America’s extraordinarily difficult
          state-level ratification process.

          keep it modern.” Americans are not so fortunate.

          exceeding the next-highest-scoring countries (Australia and
          Switzerland) by a wide margin. Not only do constitutional amendments
          require the approval of two-thirds majorities in both the House and
          the Senate; they must be ratified by three-quarters of the states. For
          this reason, the United States has one of the lowest rates of
          constitutional change in the world. According to the U.S. Senate,
          11,848 attempts have been made to amend the U.S. Constitution. But
          only 27 of them have been successful. America’s Constitution has been
          amended only 12 times since Reconstruction, most recently in 1992—more
          than three decades ago.

        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          This has important consequences. Consider the fate of the Electoral
          College. No other provision of the U.S. Constitution has been the
          target of so many reform initiatives. By one count, there have been
          more than 700 attempts to abolish or reform the Electoral College over
          the past 225 years. The most serious push during the 20th century came
          in the 1960s and ’70s, a period that saw three “close call”
          presidential elections (1960, 1968, and 1976), in which the winner of
          the popular vote very nearly lost the Electoral College.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In 1966, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, the chair of the Senate
          Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments,
          proposed a constitutional amendment to replace the Electoral College
          with direct presidential elections. Americans were on board. A 1966
          Gallup poll found 63 percent support for abolishing the Electoral
          College. That year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce polled its members
          and found them nine to one in favor of the reform. In 1967, the
          prestigious American Bar Association added its endorsement,

            >calling the Electoral College</a
          >
          “archaic, undemocratic, complex, ambiguous, indirect, and dangerous.”
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Bayh’s proposal was given a boost by the 1968 election, in which
          George Wallace’s strong third-party performance nearly threw the race
          into the House of Representatives. A shift of just 78,000 votes in
          Illinois and Missouri would have cost Nixon his Electoral College
          majority and left the outcome to the House, where Democrats held a
          majority. The result frightened leaders of both parties, who began to
          rally behind Bayh’s proposal.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          By 1969, the movement to abolish the Electoral College “seemed
          unstoppable.” Newly elected President Richard Nixon backed the
          initiative. So did Democratic Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,
          Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, House Minority Leader
          Gerald Ford, and key legislators such as Walter Mondale, Howard Baker,
          and George H. W. Bush. Constitutional reform was backed by business
          (the Chamber of Commerce) and labor (AFL-CIO), the American Bar
          Association, and the League of Women Voters.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In September 1969, the House of Representatives passed the proposal to
          abolish the Electoral College 338–70—far more than the two-thirds
          necessary to amend the Constitution. As the proposal moved to the
          Senate, a Gallup poll showed that 81 percent of Americans supported
          the reform. A<em> New York Times</em> survey of state legislators
          found that 30 state legislatures were ready to pass the amendment, six
          others were undecided, and six were slightly opposed (38 states would
          be needed for ratification). Abolition seemed well within reach.

          But the U.S. Senate killed the reform. Like so many times in the past,
          opposition came from the South and sparsely populated states. Senator
          James Allen of Alabama declared, “The Electoral College is one of the
          South’s few remaining political safeguards. Let’s keep it.” The
          longtime segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond promised to filibuster
          the bill, and Senate Judiciary Committee Chair James Eastland, another
          segregationist, “<a
            data-event-element="inline link"

            >slow-walked it through the Judiciary Committee</a
          >,” delaying it by nearly a year. When a cloture vote was finally held
          on September 17, 1970, 54 senators voted to end debate—a majority, but
          well short of the two-thirds needed to end the filibuster. When a
          second cloture vote was held 12 days later, 53 senators voted for it.
          The bill died before it ever came up for a vote.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          Bayh reintroduced his Electoral College reform bill in 1971, 1973,
          1975, and 1977. In 1977, following yet another “close call” election,
          the proposal got some traction. The new president, Jimmy Carter,
          backed the initiative, and a Gallup poll found that 75 percent of
          Americans supported it. But the bill was delayed and then, once again,
          filibustered in the Senate. When a cloture vote was finally held in
          1979, it garnered only 51 votes. Afterward,
          <em>The New York Times</em> reported that supporters of Electoral
          College reform “conceded privately that they stood little chance of
          reviving the issue unless a president was elected with a minority of
          the popular vote or the nation came disturbingly close to such a
          result.” As it turned out, reform supporters were wildly
          overoptimistic. Two presidents have been elected with a minority of
          the popular vote during the early 21st century, and yet the Electoral
          College still stands.

          Our excessively counter-majoritarian Constitution is not just a
          historical curiosity. It is a source of minority rule. The
          Constitution has always overrepresented sparsely populated
          territories, favoring rural minorities, but because both major parties
          had urban and rural wings throughout most of American history, this
          rural bias had only limited partisan consequences. This changed in the
          21st century. For the first time, one party (the Republicans) is brd
          primarily in small towns and rural areas while the other party (the
          Democrats) is brd largely in urban areas. That means that our
          institutions now systematically privilege the Republicans. The
          Republican Party won the popular vote in only one presidential
          election from 1992 to 2020—a span of nearly three decades. But thanks
          to the Electoral College, Republicans occupied the presidency for
          nearly half of that time.

        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In the U.S. Senate, Republican senators not once represented a
          majority of Americans from 2000 to 2022, but they nevertheless
          controlled the Senate for half of this

            >period</a
          >. As often as not during the 21st century, then, the party with fewer
          votes has controlled the Senate.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          In 2016, the Democrats won the national popular vote for the
          presidency and the Senate, but the Republicans nonetheless won control
          of both institutions. A president who lost the popular vote and
          senators who represented a minority of Americans then proceeded to
          fill three Supreme Court seats, giving the Court a manufactured 6–3
          conservative majority. This is minority rule.
        </p>
        <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">
          What makes the situation so dangerous is that this privileged partisan
          minority has abandoned its commitment to democratic rules of the game.
          In other words, the Constitution is protecting and empowering an
          <em>authoritarian</em> partisan minority.

          To escape this predicament, we must begin to think differently about

          itself—more like the Founders thought about it and more like
          Norwegians think about their own constitution today. In 1787, just

          Born of compromise and improvisation, the U.S. Constitution is not a
          sacred text. It is a living embodiment of the nation. Throughout our
          history, from the passage of the Bill of Rights to the expansion of
          suffrage to the civil-rights reforms of the 1960s, Americans have
          worked to make our system more democratic. But that work has stalled
          over the last half century. It is essential to reawaken the dormant
          American tradition of democratic constitutional change. Doing so will
          enable America to realize its unfinished promise of building a
          democracy for all—and perhaps be a model for the world.
